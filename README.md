# GIMPteam - A cooperative Text Editor

A cooperative text editing system developed in C++ that allows one or more users to edit the content of a document simultaneously, ensuring that different insertion or modification operations, carried out by users at the same time, produce the same effects, regardless of the order in which they are executed on the different systems in use (switching) and that repeated deletions lead to the same result (idempower).

## Requirements
Qt Creator at least v. 4.10.0 <br>
MySQL

## Notes
This project and its documentation are still under development, thus some bugs could be present! Every Issue and suggestion reported will be appreciated
